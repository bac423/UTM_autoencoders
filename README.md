Recently, I had an incredible opportunity to present on the topic of my favourite autoencoders at the Machine Learning Reading Group at the University of Toronto. With this presentation, I aimed to introduce members of our club to autoencoders as powerful algorithms of unsupervised learning.

In addition to telling about the basic structure of an autoencoder, I talked about its different aspects and applications.

* Properties of the latent space.
* Correlation between the size of the latent space and the quality of reconstructed images.
* Denoising/Completion/Variational autoencoders.
* Image morphing.
* Feature extraction and semi-supervised learning.
* Machine Translation.
* Autoencoders and modern art.

The *UTM_autoencoders.pptx* file contains the slides, and the *autoencoders101.ipynb* is the copy of the google colab, which I used to demonstrate the properties of the latent space.
